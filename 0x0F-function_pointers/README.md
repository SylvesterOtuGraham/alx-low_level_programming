Function pointers in C are variables that can store the memory address of functions and can be used in a program to create a function call to functions pointed by them. Function pointers in C need to be declared with an asterisk symbol and function parameters (same as the function they will point to) before using them in the program. Declaration of function pointers in C includes the return type and data type of different function arguments.
